**Job Advertisments**

In this project we aim to extract information from digitized job advertisements found in Dutch newspapers. We are particularly interested in the wages and occupation titles. Using this data, we can reconstruct not only wage patterns, but also social mobility over the last two centuries.

Job advertisements are recognized as advertisments by the systems of the KB (Dutch Royal Library). Individual advertisements, however, are not identified. For this reason we start with segmenting the advertisements using [...]. We also run modern OCR tools on our data, for the OCR quality is relatively poor.
